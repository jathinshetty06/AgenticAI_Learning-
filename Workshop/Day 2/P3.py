Chapter 1: Library Rules and Regulations

The Central Library at the institute is one of its most valuable resources. It operates from 
Monday to Saturday, 8 AM to 8 PM. During examination periods it remains open until 10 PM.
Students must present a valid ID card to enter the library premises.

Borrowing Policy
Students in undergraduate programs may borrow up to 3 books simultaneously. Post-graduate 
students may borrow up to 5 books. Books are issued for a period of 14 days. Books may be 
renewed once for an additional 14 days, provided no other student has placed a request.

Fines and Penalties
Late returns incur a fine of rupees 5 per day per book. If a book is lost, the student must 
replace it with a new copy of the same edition or pay three times the listed price. Damage 
to library property, including highlighting or writing in books, results in a minimum fine 
of rupees 200 per incident.

Reference Section
The reference section on the second floor houses encyclopedias, journals, and rare collections. 
Books in this section cannot be borrowed and must be read within the library. Photocopying of 
reference material is permitted to a maximum of 20 pages per visit.

Chapter 2: Laboratory Access and Usage

The Computer Science department operates five laboratories. Labs 1, 2, and 3 are general 
purpose labs with 60 workstations each. Lab 4 is the networking lab. Lab 5 is the AI/ML 
research lab with GPU-equipped workstations.

Access Hours
Regular labs are accessible during class hours (9 AM to 5 PM on working days). The AI/ML 
lab (Lab 5) requires prior booking via the departmental coordinator. During project season 
(November to April) all labs remain open until 9 PM on working days.

Equipment Booking
External drives must not be connected without the lab assistant's permission. All print jobs 
must be submitted to the lab assistant. Color printing is charged at rupees 5 per page.

Chapter 3: Fee Payment Procedures

Semester fees must be paid before the deadline specified in the academic calendar. For odd 
semesters the payment deadline is August 15. For even semesters the deadline is January 15. 

Late Payment
A late fee of rupees 500 is charged for payments made after the deadline. Students with 
outstanding dues are not permitted to appear for end-semester examinations. Fee concession 
applications must be submitted to the accounts office by July 31 for odd semesters.

Scholarship Disbursement
Government scholarship amounts are directly credited to the student's bank account. The 
institute does not handle scholarship funds. Students must ensure their bank account details 
are updated in the student portal.
